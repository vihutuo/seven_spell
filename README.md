Seven Spell is a fast, shared-round word game. Every 60 seconds, all players receive the same 7 letters. Your task is to create as many 3-letter or longer words as possible before the timer ends. After each round, a live scoreboard displays everyone’s results together

Seven Spell was built in 2024 as a class presentation project by Class 12 students of Little Star Higher Secondary School, Nagaland.
The project was created by Abhinash and Imkongsunep, guided by their teacher Vihutuo.

The app is built using the Flet framework in Python, which enables developers to create modern, interactive user interfaces entirely in Python. 

Working on Seven Spell gave the students hands-on exposure to real-world software development.

They learned how to:

* build interactive user interfaces using Python,
* manage real-time communication between multiple users,
* structure a multi-user game with synchronized timers and shared state,
* collaborate on a codebase and divide responsibilities,
* debug issues in networking, UI updates, and deployment,
* deploy a live web application using modern tools and cloud infrastructure.

Through this project, the students gained practical confidence in programming, teamwork, problem-solving, and understanding how real applications are built and delivered.
